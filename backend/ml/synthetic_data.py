"""
synthetic_data.py — Generate realistic synthetic blockchain transactions for testing.

The dataset encodes three behavioural archetypes:

1. **Normal wallets** (N0–N19)
   – 20 wallets that transact with each other infrequently, with varied amounts
     and timestamps spread over ~24 hours.  These represent ordinary users.

2. **Wash-trading ring** (M0–M5)
   – 6 wallets that rapidly cycle funds among themselves with near-equal amounts
     and very short time gaps (~30-90 s).  High internal circulation, low
     pass-through score, short inter-tx times.

3. **Layering chain** (L0–L3)
   – 4 wallets forming a linear chain (L0→L1→L2→L3→external).
     Each wallet forwards almost exactly what it receives.
     High pass-through, distinct fan-out at endpoint.

The generator is deterministic (seeded RNG) so results are reproducible.
